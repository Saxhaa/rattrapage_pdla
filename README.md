# Advanced Programming in Java -- 4IR Session 2 (2023-2024)


This base project contains a set of:

- base implementations: `Point.java` and `CountCharacters.java`
- associated tests classes: `PointTest.java` and `CountCharatersTest.java`



The test classes come with a set of `TODO`. You have to modify the base implementations (NOT the tests) so that

1. the corresponding test passes, and
2. the modified method matches what is required in its documentation comment (if any)

Advice: start with `PointTest.java`.

At the end of the test, you should deposit on moodle the two modified files (`Point.java` and `CountCharacters.java`).

The evaluation will not only take into account whether the tests pass but also the quality of the code produced.
Note that your code will be submitted to unit tests that may differ from the ones provided in this code bundle.
